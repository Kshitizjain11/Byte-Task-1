# Byte-Task-1

## Description
This repository hosts "Byte Task 1," a web development project structured as a full-stack application, comprising distinct frontend and backend components. This task likely serves as an initial assignment or challenge, focusing on fundamental web development principles and the integration of client-side and server-side logic.

A live demo of the application can be accessed at: [https://byte-task-1.vercel.app](https://byte-task-1.vercel.app)

## Features
This project is designed to demonstrate a basic full-stack web application structure. Key aspects include:

*   **Modular Architecture**: The project is divided into `frontend` and `backend` directories, promoting clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
*   **User Interface**: A web-based interface built using modern frontend technologies.
*   **API Integration**: The backend service is set up to expose API endpoints, allowing the frontend to interact and manage data.
*   **Scalable Foundation (Suggested)**: Designed with a structure that can be easily expanded for more complex features and functionalities.
*   **Data Handling (Suggested)**: Placeholder for future implementation of data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

## Installation Guide

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kshitizjain11/Byte-Task-1.git
    cd Byte-Task-1
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
    *Note: If the backend requires environment variables (e.g., for database connection strings, API keys), create a `.env` file based on a provided `.env.example` (if available) and fill in the required values.*

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    Navigate into the `frontend` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
    *Note: Similarly, if the frontend requires environment variables, configure them as needed.*

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    From the `backend` directory, run the start command:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    *This command typically starts the backend server, often on a port like `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:8080`.*

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**
    Open a new terminal window, navigate back to the `frontend` directory, and run the start command:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    *This command usually launches the frontend application in your web browser, often at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`.*

The frontend application will now be accessible in your browser, interacting with the running backend server.

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes a full-stack architecture with the following detected and inferred technologies:

*   **Primary Language**: JavaScript
*   **Frontend**: (Suggested) Likely involves HTML, CSS, and a modern JavaScript framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for building the user interface.
*   **Backend**: (Suggested) Built with Node.js, potentially leveraging a framework like Express.js for handling API routes and server logic.
*   **Package Manager**: npm or Yarn
*   **Deployment**: Vercel (as indicated by the project's homepage URL)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into distinct `frontend` and `backend` directories:

```
